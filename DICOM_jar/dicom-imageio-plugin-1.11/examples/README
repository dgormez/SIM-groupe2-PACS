WarningListener: a class implementing a trivial warning listener and used by 
other classes.

TestRead1: reads an image file of any format supported by ImageIO and 
displays the image in a swing window. Only the first frame of 
multi-frames file is displayed.

TestRead2: reads a DICOM file and displays the first frame in a swing 
window after applying possible grayscale transforms (Modality, VOI and 
Presentation LUT).

Dump: dumps the dicom meta data of a DICOM file.

TestQueryRetrieveSCU: browses the hierarchy of objects in a remote query SCP, 
retrieves objects related to a choice of patient/study/series/instance and 
stores them locally. The address and AE title of the remote query SCP
must be changed in the PeerAE constructor call.  This example uses the 
C-GET by default, but this is seldom supported by archive server.
To try C-MOVE, use the -move command line option, and ensure
that the AE title of the Q/R SCU is registered in the Q/R SCP configuration
with the correct IP address and port number. On unix/linux, with
the -move command, run the class as superuse, or specify a port greater than
1024 in the StorageSCP constructor.

TestQueryRetrieveSCP: acts as a query/retrieve SCP, serving a single object,
contained in the file supplied in argument. On unix/linux, run this class as
superuser or specify a port greater than 1024 in the QueryRetrieveSCP 
constructor call. If the SCU will send a C-MOVE command, its application 
title, IP address and port must be registered in the SCP: change the call to
registerAE accordingly.

WriteSimple: converts a mono-frame image file to dicom.

Write: converts an image file to dicom. Supports multi-frame and uses 
metadata from the input file.

WriteCompressed: like Write, but write one dicom file for each supported output compressed transfer syntax.

TestStorageSCP: listens on the default 104 port for an incoming STORE 
message, writes the received object to file "testscp.dcm" and exits. 
On unix/linux, run this class as superuser or specify a port greater than 
1024 in the StorageSCP constructor call. If the -secure flag is passed, 
a secure transport will be used and the server will listen on port 2762 
instead of 104. A valid certificate must have been stored in a keystore 
file and the javax.net.ssl.keyStore and javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword 
properties must be set. If the -raw flag is passed, received instanced are 
written to disk as is, without any decoding of metadata or pixel data.

TestStorageSCU: reads a file locally and send the DICOM object it contains to a
remote Storage SCP. Change the address, port and AE title in the PeerAE
constructor call. If the -secure flag is passed, a connexion to the SCP
using secure transport will be used. If the -raw flag is passed, the
file is read without any decoding of metadata and pixel data and
the object is sent to the SCP as is. If the -commit flag is passed, the SCP 
is requested to safekeep the object using the Storage Commitment Service Class.

TestStorageCommitmentSCU: sends a request to a Storage Commitment SCP. 
Change the address, port and AE title in the PeerAE constructor call.
Also change the SOP instance and SOP class of the object the
storage commitment is requested for. The SCP must have received
the object before, by TestStorageSCU or another mean.

TestStorageCommitmentSCP: implements a simple Storage Commitment SCP 
that accepts to safekeep all instances which it receives requests for.
The SCU must be know to the SCP so that an association can be established
by the SCP to send the result. Change the address, port and AE title
of the SCU.

TestStorageCommitmentSCP2: like TestStorageCommitmentSCP but using a 
listener to receive requests.

Raw: reads and writes a file with raw values.

FileSetRead: reads a DICOMDIR file and print out its content.

FileSetWrite: creates a DICOMDIR file in the current directory from a 
supplied list of files.

TestVerificationSCU: verifies that a remote application entity is running
and reachable.

ConvertToJpeg: converts a DICOM file to one JPEG file per frame.

ExtractPDF: extracts a PDF file from a DICOM file containing an instance 
of the Encapsulated PDF Storage SOP class.

EncapsulatePDF: encapsulates a PDF file into a DICOM file using the
Encapsulated PDF Storage SOP class.

TestBasicWorklistManagementSCU: sends a query to a Basic Worklist Management
SCP and display the result. Change the address, port, AE title in the
PeerAE constructor call. Also try to change the matching keys and return keys
to control the result.
